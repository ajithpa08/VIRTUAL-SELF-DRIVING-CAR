A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle, driverless car, or robotic car, is a car incorporating vehicular automation, that is, a ground vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.

This project is an implementation of a server that acts as the brain for a self-driving car simulation. The server communicates with a driving simulator using WebSockets to receive telemetry data, including the car's speed and camera images. The goal of the server is to process this data and send control commands (steering angle and throttle) back to the simulator to drive the car autonomously in the simulation.

Key components of the code:

Telemetry Processing: The server receives telemetry data through the 'telemetry' event, which includes the car's speed and camera image in Base64 format. The image is preprocessed to be fed into a pre-trained neural network model for predicting the appropriate steering angle.
Neural Network Model: The code loads a pre-trained neural network model (loaded using Keras) that takes the preprocessed camera image as input and predicts the steering angle to navigate the car.
Throttle Control: The server calculates the throttle value based on the car's current speed and a predefined speed limit. The throttle is adjusted to control the car's speed and prevent it from exceeding the speed limit.
Control Command Emission: The server emits the calculated steering angle and throttle as control commands to the simulator through the WebSocket connection. These commands direct the car to drive autonomously based on the predictions made by the neural network.
Flask and SocketIO: The server is implemented using Flask, a web framework, and SocketIO, a library that enables WebSocket communication. The middleware handles the WebSocket connections and data flow between the simulator and the server.
Overall, this project forms the back-end of a self-driving car simulation, where the server processes incoming data, makes predictions using a neural network model, and sends control commands back to the simulator, allowing the car to drive itself within the virtual environment.
